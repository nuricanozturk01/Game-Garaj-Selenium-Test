## Test Results
 - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB80H1Af3NVrjwVn9c4eqUvnLcBw1orU5

### Result
  - All informations (credit card etc...) are fake.
  - When I enter an non-exists email address (e.g., asd@fsdgs.com) during the sign-up process, the website accepts the email and approves the sign-up. If I enter an extremely long password during the sign-up process (20 Microsoft Office Word page long), the system accepts the password but then becomes locked.
  - In the cart section, if the number of items in the cart exceeds the maximum item limit (9223372036854775807), the system automatically reduces the item count to the maximum limit (again: 9223372036854775807).
  - There are inaccuracies in the product rankings.
  - When I entered the non-existing credit card on payment process, system accept it and show the message (like: "Your order has been received.") but gamegaraj not accept the order.

## My Opinions:
This website contains many errors and bugs like this. There are areas that need to be fixed urgently. I can enter with a non-existent email and place an order with a non-existent credit card, but of course, these orders are not approved by GameGaraj.
